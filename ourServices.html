            Have you already packed half of the house and are you sure you forgot somthing? <br>
            Can't find your hands and feet between all the lists? <br>
            Whether it's the first vacation you go on or whether it's your "who knows how much" vacation. <br>
            Whether you are planing a business meeting or a trip abroad. <br>
            A weekend vacation or a long-term adventure around the world is always more helpful if you have a list of
            the
            things to pack<br>
            Our site wil help you understand what to pack, make sure you have thought of everything you want to pack and
            make your life quicer<br>
            This is a site that will eventually issue you a list of equpment for each person, because after all each
            person
            is different and each vacation has the specific things that are in need for it.
